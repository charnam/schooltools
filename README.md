# SchoolTools
This repository's README and setup guide are currently in a "work-in-progress" state. You won't be able to set up SchoolTools for contribution yourself yet, though detailed instructions will be added here once I have enough time. Thank you for your patience. If I forget, submit an issue and I'll get to it ASAP.

## What's going on? It won't run?
Currently, I'm working on adding a live game to the site, so that people may study terms in larger groups. It is a work-in-progress, and it's possible that the site may not work properly until it is finished.
