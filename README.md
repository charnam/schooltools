# SchoolTools
This repository's README and setup guide are currently in a "work-in-progress" state. You won't be able to set up SchoolTools for contribution yourself yet, though detailed instructions will be added here once I have enough time. Thank you for your patience. If I forget, submit an issue and I'll get to it ASAP.
