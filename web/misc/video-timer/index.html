                <summary>Help: Using the Video Stopwatch</summary>
                <p>
                    To use the stopwatch, you must first either record or
                    import a video. Complete this step first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've uploaded your video, you'll notice two phrases
                    that appear often, "start frame" and "end frame."
                    The "Start Frame" is the exact time when the 
                    action you're recording starts. Right when
                    the action you're recording occurs, pause the video, and
                    click "Set Start Frame." The "End Frame" allows you to choose
                    what time your stopwatch ends.
                    Right when the action you're recording is completed,
                    click "Set End Frame."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "Segment Time" is how long the section you've chosen lasts.
                    "Segment Time" is probably what you want to write down.
