    Some schools use a system called "GoGuardian" in order
    to view student displays. That's fine and all, but the
    little bubble at the top left of the screen can be
    infuriating, especially in a live game. This site is for
    school purposes, anyway.
    
    The line below should make the bubble disappear. It's a
    "catch-all," but this is about all I can remember right now.
