    Some schools use a system called "GoGuardian" in order
    to see student displays. That's fine and all, but the
    all-seeing bubble at the top left of the screen can be
    infuriating sometimes. This site is for school purposes,
    anyway.
    
    If nothing changes, the line below should make it go away.
