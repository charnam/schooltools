            <p>
                Since I'm starting to need tools for various things
                often, I've decided to create a website where I can
                easily add more when I need them. This website is for
                school / study purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this is the first thing you've seen by me, welcome.
                The visual aesthetic here was on purpose, though behind
                the walls, everything is just as modern as it should be.
                I like websites that are simple, but also unique in
                their own way. In my opinion, modern sites are boring,
                and often cluttered with advertisements that take up
                much of your computer screen.
                I think, despite being old-fashioned, what you see here
                makes sense.

                So, what are you waiting for? Click any link at the top,
                and start studying.
